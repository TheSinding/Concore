# Concore
This is an Apple mobileconfig generator, written in nodejs.

### Disclaimer
I'm using the mobileconfig node module made by @andris9 , thanks dude!

That means its mostly based on his work, and he should be **creditted**.

I merely took his work and made a node script convenient for **me!**

However, if you'll find this usefull, then great use it to your hearts content.

It made life easier for me as a system-administrator for a company, creating .mobileconfig and distrubuting it, is so much easier then setting it up on the induvidual computers. 

### Install
```
git clone https://github.com/TheSinding/Concore.git
cd Concore
npm install
node concore.js
```

**Profit**
